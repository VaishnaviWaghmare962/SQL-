# SQL-
This SQL script creates a Cricket database and an odi_cricket_data table to store player stats like runs, wickets, matches, and awards. Data is loaded from a CSV file. Queries use CASE statements to categorize players as Legends, All-Rounders, Elite Bowlers, and more. This approach enables a structured analysis of performance.
